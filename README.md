# QuizAppProject
I wanted to create a quiz app that had good ui and was interactive and fun to play.
At this time i had been learing android studio for about 1.5 month of daily 5hrs so i didn't want my app to be too complex.
  First i just created simple quiz app with limited questions,
then i added sqlite database to make more dynamic question storage. 
Then i added few more categories in an recyclerview
My app was looking fine and was working pretty well but when i installed it in phone with different size there was major problem of layout not adapting,
so i created layout that worked in few different sizes and i modified my constrait layout to best used practice so it was more dynamic.
  Final app turned out to be quite good if i do saw so myself and i was pretty satisfied with it.

Different Components used it this app:
1. Sqlite db 
2. Recyclerview
3. Dialog box with custom layout
4. Buttons and textview with custom background 
5. Different image view
